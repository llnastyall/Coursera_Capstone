Considering all the benefits London can bring, it is also highly competitive, no surprise that cost of living is very high. It is always a challenge to find the most suitable place to rent a flat and at the same time to be quite close to all needed venues.\n\nThis Project would help the stakeholders to take a thoughtful decision on choosing the best borough to rent a flat in London based on the distribution of various facilities in and around that borough. As an example, this project would compare 2 randomly picked boroughs and analyse the top 10 most common venues in each of those two boroughs based on number of visits. Also, this project will use Machine Lerning algotihms to cluster the venues based on the unique characteristics of categories, for example: restaurants, park, coffee shop, gym etc. This would give a better understanding of the similarities and dissimilarities between the two chosen boroughs.\n\nAs the main goal, we would like to provide targeted information near property to let out for real estate agents.\n\nBeing target audience, real estate agents would benefit the most from this project, as they compete for the same customer, while customers want to find the most appropriate flat for themselves. Deep knowledge of the area and borough brings a competitive advantage."
